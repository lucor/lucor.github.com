This version includes some enhancements and fixes.

In evidence the capability to lock a host or a system so to lock all jobs at once such as the possibility to receive notification on job event (i.e. start and end).

In addition the File Watch plugin was added and the Service Check plugin now is able to check multiple services at once allowing to select the most commonly used service directly from a default list.

Help and comments are always welcome.
