This version includes some enhancements and fixes.

Now the Pear::Auth package is used for authentication and the timeout for long running jobs was added.
The memory free and mysql database table check plugins were added.
In addition the installer was improved and FCKeditor library was updated.

Help and comments are always welcome.
