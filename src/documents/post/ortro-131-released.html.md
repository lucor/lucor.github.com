This version includes some enhancements, and one very important security fix, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.

<strong>We recommend everyone update immediately.</strong>

In addition to the security fix, the Net_Nmap library was updated making the autodiscovery without OS detection more faster, the capability to upload files for plugins and the Web Service Test Plugin using SoapUI were added.

The SimpleTest and FCKeditor libraries were updated.

Help and comments are always welcome.
